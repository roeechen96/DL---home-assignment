BLOCKCHAIN
----------
A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across 
multiple nodes, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability through 
cryptographic techniques.

SMART CONTRACT
--------------
A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on a blockchain that 
automatically enforces the terms and conditions of a transaction.

GAS TOKEN
---------
A GAS token is used to cover transaction fees on blockchain networks, 
representing the cost of computing resources needed for transactions and 
smart contract executions.

ERC-20 TOKEN
------------
ERC-20 is a standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, defining a set of 
rules that enable tokens to be interoperable within the Ethereum ecosystem.

WALLET
------
A crypto wallet is a secure digital application or hardware device that stores 
users' public and private keys, allowing them to manage cryptocurrency balances, 
send, and receive transactions.

CHAINPORT BRIDGE
----------------
ChainPort is a bridge that facilitates the transfer of assets across different 
blockchain networks, allowing users to “port” tokens securely between blockchains 
like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.
